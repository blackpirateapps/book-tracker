## Features

This application is packed with features to provide a complete library management experience.

#### **Core Library Management**
* **Three Dynamic Shelves:** Organize your books into "Currently Reading," "Read," and "Watchlist."
* **Detailed Tracking:** Log start and finish dates, the reading medium (e.g., Kindle, Paperback), and more.
* **Comprehensive Metadata:** Automatically stores title, author, cover image, page count, publication date, and ISBN for every book.

#### **Public & Private Interface**
* **Public Library:** A beautifully designed, shareable, read-only view of your book collection to show others what you're reading.
* **Secure Admin Dashboard:** A private, password-protected dashboard (`/dashboard`) to manage everything.
* **Random Highlight Showcase:** The public homepage features a random highlight from your collection to pique interest and remind you of past insights.

#### **Adding & Importing Books**
* **Open Library Search:** Instantly find and add any book using the integrated Open Library API search.
* **Highlight Importer:** Easily import all your highlights from Kindle (`.html` clippings) or other services that export to Markdown (`.md` files).

#### **Advanced Features & Data Portability**
* **Automated Cover Management:** Book covers are automatically fetched, compressed into the modern `.webp` format, and permanently stored in Vercel Blob. This ensures your library's visuals are fast, optimized, and never break.
* **Data Portability & Migration:**
  * **One-Click Export:** Download your entire library as a single JSON file for backup at any time.
  * **Easy Import:** Restore your library from a JSON backup file, making migration between services painless.
* **Image Migration Tool:** A dedicated tool to process and migrate any existing book covers from external URLs to your own Vercel Blob storage, ensuring you own all your assets.

#### **Deployment & Cost**
* **Completely Free Hosting:** The entire application is designed to run on the generous free tiers of Vercel and Turso. No hidden costs or credit card required.
* **Serverless Architecture:** The application is fast, scalable, and highly efficient. You don't need to manage or pay for a server that's running 24/7.

## How It Works: The Architecture

This application is composed of two main parts:

1.  **Frontend (`/public`):** A set of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up the user interface. This includes the public-facing library (`index.html`) and the admin dashboard (`/dashboard/index.html`). Because it's static, it loads incredibly fast for all users.
2.  **Backend (`/api`):** A collection of serverless functions that handle all the logic. These functions are responsible for communicating with the database, processing images, and handling authentication. They act as a secure intermediary between the frontend and your data.

**Data Flow Example (Adding a Book):**
1.  You search for a book in the dashboard.
2.  The frontend calls the Open Library API to get book data.
3.  You click "Add to Library".
4.  The frontend sends the book data to the `/api/books.js` serverless function.
5.  This function fetches the book's cover image, converts it to a compressed `.webp` file, and uploads it to Vercel Blob storage.
6.  The function then saves all the book's details, including the new Vercel Blob URL for the cover, into your Turso database.
7.  A success message is returned to the dashboard, which then refreshes to show the new book.

## Tech Stack Deep Dive

* **Database:** [**Turso**](https://turso.tech/) provides a serverless SQLite database. We use it because it's incredibly fast (especially for read-heavy sites like the public library), easy to set up, and offers a generous free tier. It's essentially a supercharged version of the world's most popular database engine, SQLite.
* **Blob Storage:** [**Vercel Blob**](https://vercel.com/storage/blob) is used for storing book cover images. This is crucial because it prevents "hotlinking" to external image sources that could change or break. By processing and storing our own copies, we ensure the images are permanent, optimized, and delivered quickly via Vercel's Edge Network.
* **Deployment & Hosting:** [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/) is the perfect platform for this project. It seamlessly handles the deployment of the static frontend, the serverless API functions, and integrates directly with Vercel Blob storage.
* **Backend Logic:** **Node.js Serverless Functions** are used for all backend tasks. This serverless approach means you don't have to manage a traditional server. The functions only run when they're called, which is highly efficient and cost-effective.
* **Frontend Interface:** Built with **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This choice keeps the application lightweight, fast, and easy to understand without the overhead of a large framework.
* **Styling:** [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) allows for rapid UI development with a utility-first approach, resulting in a clean and modern design that is fully responsive.
* **Image Processing:** The [**Sharp**](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) library is a high-performance Node.js tool used within our serverless function to resize and convert images to the modern `.webp` format, reducing file sizes by up to 80% without sacrificing quality.

## Deployment Guide (Vercel)

Follow these steps to deploy your own instance of Book Tracker.

### Prerequisites

* **Vercel Account:** [Sign up for free](https://vercel.com/signup).
* **Turso Account:** [Sign up for free](https://turso.tech/).
* **GitHub Account:** [Sign up for free](https://github.com/).
* **Turso CLI:** You need this command-line tool to manage your database. Follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.turso.tech/cli/installation).

### Step 1: Set Up Your Turso Database

First, we'll create the database where all your book data will be stored.

1.  **Log in to Turso from your terminal:**
    ```bash
    turso auth login
    ```
2.  **Create a new database.** Give it a unique name.
    ```bash
    turso db create your-database-name
    ```
3.  **Get the database URL.** This is the address your application will use to connect to the database.
    ```bash
    turso db show your-database-name --url
    ```
    **Copy the `libsql` URL that is displayed.** You will need it in a later step.

4.  **Create an authentication token.** This acts as a password for your database.
    ```bash
    turso db tokens create your-database-name
    ```
    **Copy the token that is generated.** You will also need this later.

### Step 2: Fork the Repository

Click the **"Fork"** button at the top-right of the project's GitHub page to create your own copy of the Book Tracker repository.

### Step 3: Set Up Your Vercel Project & Blob Storage

Now, we'll connect your forked repository to Vercel and set up the storage for your book covers.

1.  Go to your Vercel Dashboard and click **"Add New..."** -> **"Project"**.
2.  Choose **"Import Git Repository"** and select the repository you just forked.
3.  Vercel will automatically detect the project settings. Before deploying, navigate to the **"Storage"** tab.
4.  Select the **"Blob"** option and click **"Create Database"**.
5.  Give your Blob store a name (e.g., `book-tracker-covers`), select a region, and click **"Create"**.
6.  Vercel will ask if you want to link it to your project. Click **"Link"**. This will automatically add the necessary `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` environment variable to your project.

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

This is the final configuration step. In your Vercel project settings, go to the **"Environment Variables"** section and add the following three secrets.

* **`TURSO_DATABASE_URL`**: The `libsql://...` URL you copied from Turso in Step 1.
* **`TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`**: The authentication token you generated from Turso in Step 1.
* **`ADMIN_PASSWORD`**: Create a strong, unique password. This is what you will use to log in to the admin dashboard.

### Step 5: Deploy!

Navigate back to the **"Deployments"** tab for your project and trigger a new deployment (or redeploy the last one). Vercel will now build your project with all the correct environment variables and deploy it to the web.

Congratulations! Your personal Book Tracker is now live.

## Getting Started & Usage

1.  **Access Your Dashboard:** Go to your Vercel URL and add `/dashboard` to the end (e.g., `https://your-project-name.vercel.app/dashboard`).
2.  **Log In:** A password prompt will appear. Enter the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you set in the environment variables. You can check the "Remember me" box to stay logged in.
3.  **Add Your First Book:** Use the search bar to find a book via the Open Library. Click "Reading" or "Watch" to add it to a shelf.
4.  **Manage Your Library:** Navigate to the "My Library" page to move books between shelves, edit details, and add highlights.

## Local Development

If you wish to run the project on your local machine:

1.  Clone your forked repository: `git clone <your-repo-url>`
2.  Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project.
4.  Add your environment variables to this file:
    ```
    TURSO_DATABASE_URL="libsql://..."
    TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN="..."
    ADMIN_PASSWORD="..."
    BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="..." # Get this from your Vercel project's storage tab
    ```
5.  Install the Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
6.  Start the development server: `vercel dev`

This will start a local server that emulates the Vercel environment, including running the serverless functions.
